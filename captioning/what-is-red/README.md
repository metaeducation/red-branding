This is the subtitling of Nenad Rakocevic's talk from Recode 2013, called "What is Red".

It is 47 minutes long, and provides a thorough overview of the system's goals and implementation methodology.  As of February 2014, it is probably the best single resource for coming up to speed on the project...so subtitling is helpful for helping Red spread.

The subtitle files are in [the .SRT "SubRip" format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubRip).  To add a translation to another language, leave the timing information intact but replace the line of text.

Thanks to everyone for their help in translating!
